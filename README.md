# AAA NLP Engine + Heatmap

ConsumerAffairs_LDA.ipynb - Python script performing NLP (Natural Language Processing) for the purpose of topic modeling. This model peforms topic modeling on the 
customer reviews from the American Automobile Association (AAA) website https://www.consumeraffairs.com/automotive/aaa.html

wkMapTest.ipynb - Python script mapping the results from 'ConsumerAffairs_LDA.ipynb' in a geospatial heatmap using choropleth map from plotly. The script uses a geoJSON 
file containing the shapes for every US city. Attached below is a screenshot of how the map looks. 

• Utilized PyTorch and TensorFlow to train and develop a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeler, enabling accurate identification and categorization of topics within a large corpus of text data
• Employed Jupyter notebooks to develop robust web-scraping scripts, effectively extracting consumer reviews related to the auto-services company AAA. The scraped data served as the foundation for training, testing, and modeling the NLP engine
• Conducted extensive feature engineering to enhance the testing accuracy of the model. By carefully selecting and engineering relevant features from the consumer reviews, the model's performance and predictive capabilities were significantly improved
• Leveraged geoJSON files and powerful plotting libraries in Python to create an informative geospatial heat map. This visualization depicted the geographical distribution of review origins, providing valuable insights into customer sentiment and topics discussed in each region
• Performed sentiment analysis on the reviews, enabling a concise analysis of the sentiment expressed in each review. This sentiment analysis, along with the identified topic, was presented alongside the geospatial heat map, providing a comprehensive overview of the reviews and their implications
• By implementing these enhancements, the overall project achieved a higher level of sophistication and effectiveness, empowering deeper understanding and actionable insights from the consumer reviews gathered
